Recursion:
    Base Condition:
        The condition that is used to terminate the recursive calls,
    Stack OverFlow Error:
        When the input size is higher, too many calls are getting stored in the stack memory, so after 
    particular limit, the stack memory gets full, so we do get the stack overflow error.
