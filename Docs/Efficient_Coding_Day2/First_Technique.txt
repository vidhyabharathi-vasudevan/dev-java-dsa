Backtracking:
    Divide problem into sub-problem
    not all sub-problem will give the solution
    if we divide the problem into sp1,sp2,sp3(Sub problem)
    if we get the solution at sp1 we will not go to sp2
    if we don't get the solution at sp1 will go to the sp2 and solve
    continue till we get the solution


    Not all sub-problem will give the solution

    Recursion is one of the way to solve back tracking
